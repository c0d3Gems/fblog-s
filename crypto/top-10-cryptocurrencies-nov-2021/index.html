	<h1>Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Invest in November 2021</h1>
	<p>There&#39;s no easy way anymore when it comes to picking a cryptocurrency to invest in. It gets so
		confusing, especially if you&#39;re a starter because there are thousands of different
		cryptocurrencies, and tokens available. Which one is legit, which one is a scam? Well, there are
		some key factors you can look into when deciding if a crypto project is a scam or not. But
		first, let&#39;s have a look at our top 10 cryptocurrencies we are paying attention to in November
		2021.
	</p>
	<h2>1. Bitcoin (BTC) • Market cap: Over $1.17 Trillion</h2>
	<p>Created in 2009 by an anonymous person, under the nickname &quot;Satoshi Nakamoto&quot;, Bitcoin (BTC) is
		the original crypto. Bitcoin, like most other cryptocurrencies, runs on a distribution system of
		computers, called a &quot;blockchain&quot;. This &quot;blockchain&quot; is the entire banking system of the crypto;
		it validates transactions automatically so that people are not needed anymore to do it manually,
		like in a traditional banking system, it keeps the record of your ongoing transactions, your
		current balance in your wallet. You can also contribute to making it more secure, by mining.
		Bitcoin mining is a device, that is connected to the network and becomes part of it. All it
		does, is help process transactions, all for a small fee. That fee is yours to keep. This
		blockchain is what&#39;s exciting about Bitcoin and crypto in general because it&#39;s a secure, and
		automated system, which manages to keep fraudsters away. Bitcoin&#39;s price has skyrocketed as its
		popularity grew. Five years before this day, you could&#39;ve bought Bitcoin for about $500. Today,
		though, a single Bitcoin is worth over $62000. That&#39;s a growth of about 12300%, in five years.
	</p>
	<h2>2. Ethereum (ETH) • Market cap: Over $520 Billion</h2>
	<p>This one is a bit more complex, but it&#39;s more interesting because of that. Why, you ask? well,
		Ethereum is both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform. It provides developers with a
		concept of smart contracts, which then can be used for applications. Well, we have a specific
		term for the decentralized apps, we call them &quot;dapps&quot;, for short. If you ever heard of NFTs, or
		non-fungible tokens, those are using this mechanism. Ethereum has seen also extreme growth over
		the years. Compared to Bitcoin, its price went from $11 to over $4400, in the last five years, a
		growth of almost 40000%
	</p>
	<h2>3. Binance Coin (BNB) • Market cap: Over $88 Billion</h2>
	<p>The Binance Coin is a cryptocurrency that you might have used without knowing, if you ever
		traded on Binance, one of the (if not the) biggest crypto exchanges in the world. This coin can
		be either traded, or it is used to pay fees on the Binance platform. Ever since its debut in
		2017, Binance Coin has seen big expansions. It is now used for trading, payment processing, or
		even booking travel arrangements. You can even create your cryptocurrency, using the Binance
		Smart Chain, and you&#39;ll have to use Binance Coin to provide liquidity. From 2017 until now,
		Binance Coin has seen a 530000% growth, from $0.10 to over $530.
	</p>
	<h2>4. Tether (USDT) • Market cap: Over $70 Billion</h2>
	<p>Unlike other cryptocurrencies, Tether is what we call, a &quot;stable coin&quot;. That means, it is backed
		by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro, and, in theory, it keeps a value equal to
		these denominations. Hypothetically, this means Tether&#39;s value is consistent than other
		cryptocurrencies, and thus, it&#39;s preferred by investors who are scared about the extreme
		fluctuation of other crypto coins.
	</p>
	<h2>5. Cardano (ADA) • Market cap: Over $66 Billion</h2>
	<p>This one has a bit of an interesting story, as well. Although it started a bit late in the
		crypto space, Cardano is noticeable for its proof-of-stake validation mechanism. This validation
		mechanism, unlike Bitcoin&#39;s and Ethereum&#39;s proof-of-work mechanism, decreases energy usage, and
		thus, the impact on the environment by removing the mining process. Cardano also has the smart
		contract capability that Ethereum has, for decentralized applications, and is powered by ADA,
		the native coin of Cardano. Cardano&#39;s ADA has seen modest growth, compared to the others, in
		2017, ADA&#39;s price was about $0.02, but in 2021, the price is about $2.01 for 1 ADA. In
		percentages, that&#39;s an increase of almost 10000%.
	</p>
	<h2>6. Solana (SOL) • Market cap: Over $60 Billion</h2>
	<p>Welcome to the decentralized finance (Defi) world! Using decentralized apps (DApps) and smart
		contracts, Solana has come with a new hybrid concept of both proof-of-stake and proof-of-history
		mechanisms, that prove transactions happened quickly and securely. The native token of Solana is
		called SOL. Ever since its beginning in 2020, SOL&#39;s price was about $0.77, but by 2021, the
		price got to almost $201. A growth of about 26000%.
	</p>
	<h2>7. XRP (XRP) • Market cap: Over $50 Billion</h2>
	<p>Create by some of the same founding people of Ripple, a digital and payment processing company,
		XRP can be used on the Ripple network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types,
		including normal currencies like USD or EUR, but major cryptocurrencies, too. In 2017, XRP
		started by having a price of $0.006. Fast forward into 2021, the price got to $1.08, resulting
		in a rise of 17900%.
	</p>
	<h2>8. Polkadot (DOT) • Market cap: Over $43 Billion</h2>
	<p>Cryptocurrencies may use some blockchains, but Polkadot wishes to integrate all of them, by
		creating a network of cryptocurrencies that connects to all kinds of blockchains so that they
		can all work together. This concept may change how cryptocurrencies are managed and because of
		it, the growth from 2020 till 2021 was from $2.93 to $44.19, about 1400%.
	</p>
	<h2>9. Shiba Inu (SHIB) • Market Cap: Over $41 Billion</h2>
	<p>Starting in the mid-2020, Shiba Inu is what crypto enthusiasts call a &quot;meme&quot; coin. Shiba Inu
		runs, underneath, on the Ethereum network. The initial price of SHIB was $0.0000000014 and today
		it still trades below a cent but has risen immensely, to $0.00007567, a growth of 5,400,000%.
	</p>
	<h2>10. Dogecoin (DOGE) • Market Cap: Over $38 Billion</h2>
	<p>Dogecoin is another &quot;meme&quot; coin, but thanks to celebrities and billionaires like Elon Musk, it
		has gained a lot of popularity and value. Starting as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin rapidly became
		popular thanks to its dedicated community and creative memes. Another interesting fact about
		Dogecoin is that there&#39;s an infinite supply of it, but that exposes the coin to susceptible
		devaluation as supply increases. There are petitions signed by Dogecoin fans to make the supply
		limited so that the value will increase, but that decision remains up to the Dogecoin developers
		to take. Nevertheless, Dogecoin&#39;s price from 2017 to 2021 has seen a 145000% increase, from
		$0.0002 to $0.29. If you decide to invest in any of these cryptocurrencies, please make your due
		diligence and research. Reading articles like this one is a great start, but not enough. Also,
		be responsible while investing, and don&#39;t invest money you can&#39;t lose.
